TikTok recently made some changes to their frontend UI, and this has been causing some users to experience crashes while running the TikTok Captcha Solver Python Client. If you use the Python client, please update to the latest version at your earliest convenience.

<br/>
The command to update to the latest version is <strong>pip install tiktok-captcha-solver --upgrade</strong>
